        <!-- TASK 1 -->

        <!-- 
            Use an if-else statement to check if they are eligible to vote 
            (assume the voting age is 18). Print an appropriate message. 
        -->


        <!-- TASK 2 -->

        <!-- 
            check if a person is eligible to drive based on their age. The
            legal driving age is 18. Write a JavaScript program that uses 
            the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print a 
            message stating whether a person is eligible to drive or not.
         -->

        <!-- TASK 3 -->

        <!-- 
            Add a new fruit, let's say "Banana," to the end of the fruits 
            array using the push() method. Use the splice() method to remove 
            the third element from the fruits array and replace it with "Grapes."
         -->

        <!-- TASK 4 -->

        <!-- 
            Use the filter() method to create a new array that contains only
             the even numbers from an array of numbers.
         -->

        <!-- TASK 5 -->

        <!-- 
            const expenses = 
            [
                { description: "Groceries", amount: 50, category: "Food" },
                { description: "Dinner", amount: 30, category: "Food" },
                { description: "Movie", amount: 15, category: "Entertainment" },
                { description: "Gas", amount: 40, category: "Transportation" },
                { description: "Books", amount: 25, category: "Education" },
            ];
            
            PART-1 

            Write a for loop that iterates through the expenses array and prints
            each expense's description and amount in the format: "Expense: 
            [description], Amount: [amount]".


            PART 2

            Use the forEach method to achieve the same result as in question 
            1. The output should be identical.

            PART 3

            Write a for...of loop to iterate through the expenses array and
            print only the descriptions of the expenses

            PART 4

            Use the map method to create a new array containing only the
            amounts of the expenses. Print the new array.

            PART 5

            Use the filter method to create a new array that includes only the
            expenses with amounts greater than or equal to 30. Print the new array.
        
            PART 6

            Use the reduce method to calculate the total amount of all expenses. Print the total.
            
            PART 7 

            Chain the map, filter, and reduce methods to create a pipeline that first doubles 
            the amount of each expense, then filters for expenses with amounts greater than 60,
             and finally calculates the total of these filtered expenses. Print the final result.
